# Workshop Series - Developing CLN Plugins

![developing-cln-plugins-graphic](https://github.com/pleb-devs/developing-cln-plugins/assets/108303703/010722a5-6d78-44dc-a07a-c8c69f124ced)

This is a 2 (maybe 3) part Plebdev workshop series where I will walk you through everything from setting up your development environment to building your first C-Lightning plugin. This will all be live-streamed, and recordings will show up here as they happen.

## Introduction

Building a CLN plugin was one of what felt like my first 'real' bitcoin projects. The development process involves everything from running a node to writing code and understanding how the underlying protocols are working. For this reason, not only are plugins fun to build, but also a great way to learn! 

In this workshop series, I hope to walk you through every step and get you confident in building plugins. This will require you to get both bitcoin and lightning nodes running on your development machine. Then, we will learn about CLN plugins: what are they, how they work, and how to build them. Finally, we will be building a plugin using the `pyln-client` library.

If you don't already identify as a bitcoin developer, you will certainly earn that title after going through this series.

## Livestreams

- Environment Setup - Sunday October, 22 @ 1pm PT -- 3pm CT -- 4pm ET
  - Get bitcoin and lightning nodes running locally
  - Become familiar with the command line and basic node CLI commands
- CLN Plugin Architecture - Sunday November, 5 -- **DATE SUBJECT TO CHANGE**
- Building a CLN Plugin in Python - **TBD**

## Recordings

No recordings yet...

## Prerequisites

- none!

**This will be a technical workshop, but it will be easy to follow along with.**

**Need help? Join our Discord and we'll do our best!**

## What you'll need

1. Computer
2. Knowledge? Not really, but it can be helpful

### Computer

If you want to follow along, you'll need a computer (preferably Mac or Linux). 

Bring whatever you have, but the workshop will be done on _Ubuntu 22.04_. Mac users may have to do some extra googling or reach out to our Discord. *Most* Linux distros should work the same. If you're on Windows... 

### Knowledge

The goal is to hold your hand through each step, but some programming knowledge will help you get going.

If you want to do some reading ahead of time, I'd recommend:

- [CLN Docs on Plugin Dev](https://docs.corelightning.org/docs/plugin-development)
- [CLN API Reference](https://docs.corelightning.org/reference)
- [Bitcoin Core API Reference](https://developer.bitcoin.org/reference/rpc/)

## Getting Started

Each subdirectory contains any relevant code and a README with instructions. 

These are still a WIP, but expect to see each topic completed by the time the live stream is released.

You should follow along in the following order:

1. [Environment Setup](https://github.com/pleb-devs/developing-cln-plugins/tree/main/environment-setup)

#### Stay tuned for parts 2 and 3 where we will dive into CLN plugin architecture and start building a plugin
